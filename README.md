# Hashing---Python-for-Password-Security
Argon2 is a key derivation function (KDF) and password hashing algorithm designed to securely hash passwords and protect against various cryptographic attacks, including brute force and dictionary attacks.
It was selected as the winner of the Password Hashing Competition in 2015 due to its resistance to side-channel attacks and memory-hardness properties, making it difficult for attackers to efficiently compute hashes in parallel or with specialized hardware. 
Hashing, in general, is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information such as passwords because it converts plaintext data into a fixed-size string of characters that cannot be easily reversed or decrypted. 
Hashing ensures that even if a database is compromised, the original passwords remain hidden, enhancing the overall security of systems and protecting user privacy.
